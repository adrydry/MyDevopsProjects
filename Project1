INSTALL JENKINS ON AWS EC2 INSTANCE, INTEGRATE GIT, MAVEN, TERRAFORM

Jenkins is a CI CD tool that help to automate all activities related to building, testing and deploying applications. It's one of the most CICD tool because, it's an open source and can be integrated with multiple others tools. For our project, we will work on AWS cloud platform. To execute this project, we will follow the steps below:
        A - INSTALL JENKINS
1- Create an EC2 instance on AWS and name it Jenkins Server. In this project, we will work with Ubuntu;
2- Connect this machine to the server using Gitbash. We can also use Putty or Mobaxterm as well;
3- Become a root user by execute the command : sudo su -;
4- Update the repository: apt-get update -y;
5- Install Java. Java is a prerequisite before any installation of Jenkins. To install java, we must follow some steps:
    - Execute: apt install default-jdk  - This command will install directly the compatible version of Java with your OS;
    - Check the installation of Java by using: java --version;
    - After Java is installed, we need to define the environnement variable of the Java file (JAVA_HOME, PATH);
    - Execute the command : file $(which java). A symbolic link, will appear. Copy it;
    - To know where the file is located, execute : file + symbolic link;
    - Go to the home directory with cd ~ and execute ls -la to see all the files or directories for the home directory. We will see a file name .bash_profile. Open this file by usind the command vi;
    - Inside the file define Java_Home and the path. Save and quit the file;
    - To verify if the environnement variable is effectively set, just execute first source .bash_profile, and next echo $JAVA_HOME and echo $PATH. 
    
    Now Java is installed and the environnement variable is set, we can installed Jenkins. To install Jenkins, go to google and tape Jenkins download. Select the first link and choose the command to execute depending on your OS.
    In our case, we will just copy the link and paste it in our command like this: wget link.   The command wget will help us to douwnload the jenkins war. After downloading, the jenkins war, we need to install it by using the command java -jar jenkins.war
    Now jenkins is install and a password is automatically generated by the system.
    To verify, the installation of jenkins, just paste in google, the Public adress of our ec2 with the default Jenkins port 8080 ---Ip:8080. After enter, the jenkins page appear.
    Great, our jenkins server is ready!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
